# Movie search engine
This is a search engine, whose data set is set of bollywood scripts. Based on the natural language query by the user, it should produce a result showing what movie it most probably will be.(In addition we are also planning to display probabilities of other movies too)

## It consists of three parts
- React JS (for the frontend)
- Flask which will contain NLP part(the server part)

# Setting up the frontend
- `npm install`
- `npm start` 
- Frontend will be runnning on `http://localhost:30000`
