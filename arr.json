She walks inside to \u00dend \nHaider dancing with full gusto with the group. She is happy \nto see him so cheerful. Haider notices her while dancing.

Suddenly, he sees the Salmans \nlooking at them from behind a tree. 155HAIDER lkys tklwl\u00c9 Bloody spies!He grabs her hand and runs deeper into the village. Salman \nand Salman follow them. A chase begins - Haider manages \nto smartly evade the Salmans, who are now lost in the \nlabyrinth of the village lanes. They run around but don\u00d5t \n\u00dend them anywhere.

The seating surrounds the \ncentral open space, like an amphitheatre. Guests congratulate Ghazala and Khurram who sit at the \ncentre, on two throne-like chairs. Parvez, with Arshia to his \nside, accompanies Khurram. The Bhaand Pather begins. Masked entertainers come \ntwirling in with the sounds of live instruments. The lead \nnarrator, a masked Haider, begins the play. The players - \nthe old king, the new king and the queen, along with their \nsubjects. The lyrics tell the story of the newly-crowned king after he \nbetrayed and murdered his own brother, the older king. \nThe song tells of how the new king longed for the queen and \nwould do anything to have her. The old king was considered \na traitor by the feudal lord who conquered their kingdom. \nHis brother was hand-in-glove with the feudal lord, therefore \nthey both conspired to trap the old king and killed him to \nensure that the kingdom and the queen would be the new \nking\u00d5s forever. \nThere are details of the killing, with the body being thrown \nfrom the \u00d4Zero Bridge\u00d5.

ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD - DIGGER\u00d5S HOME \nThe nozzle of an AK 47 stealthily peeps out from the second-\n\u00dfoor window. Ali is behind the gun aiming at the  two dead \nbodies. 192 EXT.

At every chance they get they open \u00dere, \nonly to be met with retaliatory \u00dere from the windows. 194 INT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD - DIGGER\u00d5S HOME \nMohsin has taken position at a window and is unleashing an \nonslaught of gun-\u00dere towards the Ikhwaan soldiers. All the while Haider holds Arshia\u00d5s body and softly reads a \npoem to her. \n195 I/E. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD \nBy now a full-\u00dfedged battle is taking place between the \nIkhwaans and the gravedigger family. \nTwo Ikhwaani soldiers manage to reach and hide below the \nplace where Ali was \u00dering from. As Ali opens the window, \nthe two Ikhwaan soldiers shower bullets. Ali screams and \nfalls back. The gravedigger runs to the room to \u00dend Ali dead \n204in a pool of blood. The gravedigger holds his dead body and \nhowls. Haider notices the two soldiers coming closer. He quickly \nreaches an AK47 but fumbles as he tries to load it. The \nIkhwaanis are barely a few feet away from him now, only a \nwall separates them. He struggles, barely managing to cock \nthe weapon and \u00dere rather amateurishly, killing one of the \ntwo just as they appear from behind the wall. The other \nretreats. The grieving gravedigger picks up a grenade, runs out of \nthe house and hurls it onto an Ikhwaan jeep. The jeep \nexplodes, Khurram rolls over behind the rock as the bodies \n\u00dfy apart. The gravedigger is showered with bullets by the \nother Ikhwaanis. 196 EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD \nKhurram gets up and looks from behind the rock. A few \nIkhwaanis try to move towards the structure, Mohsin and \nHaider both \u00dere bullets from different vantage points inside \nthe house. They rush to different windows to \u00dere more \nrounds, giving the impression of several people inside the \nhouse. Ikhwaanis immediately turn back. Khurram pulls out his \nsatellite phone and dials a number. \n197 INT. ARMY CAMP - DAY \nMurthy is in conversation with some of\u00decers inside his \nroom.

CUT TO: 198 EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD \nKhurram bangs his phone on the rock and looks at the \nIkhwaan commander in frustration. They turn to the sound \nof a vehicle arriving from far. \nA jeep with a few Ikhwaanis stops a few metres away. The \nsoldiers show a rocket launcher from inside.

Veera is sitting, sipping water, trying \nto feel better. Mahabir moves, looks at Veera, then walks across to the side. He stops, \nfeels Veera\u00d5s p\nresence behind. He walks to the front of the tempo, a few more steps \nahead. He walks behind a bush, looks back, then begins to take a leak. After a second, \nhe hears the sound of Veera getting out of the tempo. He springs, but he is already \nurinating, has t\no finish. He tries to look, but can not see anything. He tries to finish in \na hurry. \n Mahabir rushes to the tempo, Veera is not in the carrier. He swears and looks \naround, then rushes to the middle of the road. He looks in both directions. Then he \nturns ba\nck towards the tempo and runs.

Mahabir is \nsleeping the\nre. Veera \nlies down to go to sleep. \n Next morning, a train comes wh\nizzing on the tracks and crosses\n.

As Veera sits next to him and looks out of the tempo. They \nare alone in the cabin\n.  The tempo is crossing an area crowde\nd by trucks. \n Veera raises her shawl over her head, largely covering her face. She looks \ntowards Mahabir for approval. He glances. She slinks a little lower to be more \ninconspicious. Mahabir looks away, she looks front. \n Rajasthan passing. \n Later Mahabir d\nrives and \nAadoo\n sits next to him. Veera is at the trap window, \nlooking at the highway in front. \n Music changes as a tea glass emerges from below the lowered flap of the \ntempo.

Aadoo is walking away to the tea stall to return the glass, Mahabir is \nstanding over there, finishing his tea, making to leave. Veera lies down on the floor of \nthe tem\npo and looks out. A group of  Rajasthani musicians are gathered in a shack, \nplaying music. This is a crossroads near the Panjab border. Mahabir and Aadoo are \nwalking up candidly, talking to each other. Veera watches. Mahabir indicates to \nAadoo, Aadoo comes\n to the \ntempo rear\n, closes \nthe flap\n. Rajasthan fades away into the evening. \n The Highway rolls at night.

The sound of the gospel spreads over the countryside. A group of small kids play football with a plastic bottle in the village square.SUPER appears- CUANGO VALLEY,ANGOLAINT.

The camera travels with her as she walks into the room to set the dinner table.An old couple and two three male elders, sit around the table. There is tension in the air. Leading the discussion is WELKETT, the husband of the pregnant lady. They notice her presence and the argument stops. DANIEL mimics the size of her belly.DANIELShe can\u00d5t \nget out of the door of the house with the size of her belly and you are asking us to leave the village.LIBERTA puts the soup bowls on the table. Her eyes meet her husband\u00d5s. They share a tense look. She leaves the room.EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET - WOODSA jeep noiselessly comes to a stop as the engine is shut. CAJETAN, a rugged young man of 32, sits inside with 3 of his friends.Cajetan puts on the stereo and shuffles around for the knob. Just when the music blares out,the senior occupant slaps his hands and chides him in whispers. Cajetan glares back at him. They all sit quietly in the stillness for a while. Cajetan starts humming the song softly under his breath. The sun dies over the horizon.INT.

His mother shrugs her shoulders and settles back for dinner.LIBERTA      (Turns to VERA)         He says there may be twins this time..VERA makes a silent gesture of prayer as DANIEL smiles and shows his son two fingers. The son looks concerned.EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-WOODSTwo dozen heavily armed soldiers of the rebel militia  now troop out noiselessly, last among them is Cajetan.

AFRICAN HAMLET-LOCAL CHURCH The rebels have now reached the outside of the church.INT. AFRICAN HAMLET- LOCAL CHURCHThe gospel inside reaches a crescendo.EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-VILLAGE HOUSE-BACKYARD A tiny fist opens and two identical twin diamonds glisten in the dark. The other boys look on dazzled as the diamonds glisten in the dark. Suddenly, heavy sounds of gunfire are heard.INT. AFRICAN HAMLET- LOCAL CHURCHThe rebels mercilessly shoot the villagers inside the church. The church walls are splashed in red. The organ is shots to bits.EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE SQUAREAs we cut outside, we see the rebels storming the village, cutting down whoever gets in the way. As people run out in the village square, they get caught in the gunfire. Innocent villagers crumple by the dozen. Cajetan is at the forefront and seems to enjoy the destruction brought upon by his gun.                     4.EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE SQUARE/HOUSENow the natives also go for their guns. As the action spreads from the main village square, a bloodbath begins. The crossfire intensifies as young village boys,no more than 15,fire back at the rebels. They are led by the family elders, including the husband and DANIEL,who give stiff resistance to the rebels.Even as his comrades fall around him,Cajetan keeps shooting until the magazine runs out. He throws the gun away and quickly darts behind a wall as bullets thud in the cement, dangerously close to his face.He crouches in the mud and now approaches the village house stealthily. He takes out his machete and ambushes the family members from behind. Crying at the top of his voice, he hacks WELKETT and DANIEL. Limbs fly left and right as Cajetan goes on a rampage. He almost breaks through the last line of defence when a man, pretending to be dead, shoots back at him. Cajetan curses and falls back and the \u00d4man\u00d5, \nwho is actually GERSELINO, rushes inside to make a getaway. INT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSEAs the rebels follow him into the house, they are surprised by a sudden burst of gunfire. As the first lot is cut down,we realize that VERA and the pregnant woman are firing away from automatic guns. After a brief gun battle, the woman and her daughter in law are both silenced by the rebels\u00d5 \nguns.As the smoke settles,the injured Cajetan takes out his pistol and crawls towards the kids corner of the house. The boy is on his way out through the window. Cajetan fires several times and GERSELINO crumples near the window. Cajetan drags himself forward. The boy has something clutched in his hand. Cajetan\u00d5s \neyes glimmer as he sees the two uncut diamonds in the dying youngster\u00d5s \ngrasp.His curiosity piqued, Cajetan groans and pushes himself closer to the kid. The diamonds shine in the dark. Just then someone calls out for him. He looks out of the window as his fellow soldiers shout for him.EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSEReinforcements head towards the house.INT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSECajetan looks back at the diamonds, sweating and breathing heavily. He moves closer to the stones, leaving a trickle of blood on the floor.As the voices of the soldiers come closer, Cajetan is torn between replying to their sermons and picking the stones from the dead boy\u00d5s \nhand. The moment is prolonged -                     5.As the camera soars above the village, the remains of the burnt bodies and house fires dot the evening landscape.                    CHARLIE (V.O.)Main f ko f bolta hoon, aur mere baap ne marte hue kaha tha ki beta Charlie, yaad rakhna... life badi kutti cheez hai.

It drizzles slightly. We cut to a close shot of a pair of eyes. This is CHARLIE, a young athletic boy in his twenties. As the rain pours down on him, he chooses the left lane and makes a dash. Cut to a group of young ruffian types who are running at the top of their lungs. Some of them brandish knives and chains. They scream at someone to stop. Cut back to Charlie. He runs between a parallel pair of tracks when two trains pass by in opposite directions. Visual freeze:CHARLIE (V.O.)Paifa kamaane ke do raaste hain, ek fhortcut aur doosra chota fhortcut.EXT.

He takes a short cut through the bogies and climbs on to the roof.                     6.What follows is an amazing display of fleet footedness as Charlie sprints like a gazelle, jumping from one wagon roof to another. He finally starts to close in on his prey.Cut to the prey. BURGESS, late twenties, runs for his life as Charlie and the goons breathe down his neck. Rivers of sweat run down his face as he keeps turning back in fear.

Her laughter rings out like a chime as Charlie turns and walks towards camera. Suddenly a crisp red 1000 rupee note flies out of somewhere and sticks to the side of his face. As Charlie tries to shrug it, it darts off.EXT. RACE COURSE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAYA playful gambol begins now as the late afternoon breeze sails the note across the race course. Charlie pirouettes behind, trying to grab at it. Its a little tease as the note manages to stay just out of reach.CHARLIE (V.O.)Mere fapne, mere pyare pyare, chote chote dreams.I/E. RACE COURSE - BETTING RING - SAMEThe chase intensifies now as the note tries to duck into some  dark enclosure. Charlie gives it one final lunge.                     7.As he snatches it out thin air, the lights come on and large balloons burst over Charlie\u00d5s head, showering him with a hail \nof red currency notes. Its a surprise! Charlie looks around and realizes he is in the betting ring. The well heeled folk stand all around and clap heartily as Charlie is led forward by the motley crowd. The notes keep falling out of the sky as a bemused Charlie starts to blush.CHARLIE (V.O.)Jahaan mein hoon aur mere chaaron aur bapu baras hain.. Bimal Jalan, C Rangachari, Y V Reddy.. note par chape har governor ka naam zabaani yaad hai mujhe.. Jo aksar meri neendon se mere kaano mein gungunaya karte hain... Hum Charlie ko jitna chaahe utna rupya ada karne ka vachan dete hain..  As the crowd parts, Charlie sees something square and large, wrapped in red chiffon, loom ahead. The same pretty friend now appears in view and gifts him a horse whip. Charlie accepts it in a daze and walks up to the red box. As the cheers behind get lustier, he picks up the whip and cracks it right next to the cloth. The cloth starts to slide off, revealing a spanking new betting window. Charlie\u00d5s eyes \nmoisten slightly. CHARLIEMeri jaan.. Mera jahaan..

As Fanaa - the race horse - is piped at the post, Charlie's face falls. The PA System announces the winner glowingly - \u00d4Blue Thunder\u00d5. The people in the adjoining box hug and celebrate. \nMujib and Shumon look impassive as they take off the binoculars. CHARLIE (V.O.)Log favorite ghode ke jeetne pe paife lagate hain, aur hum haarne pe.

He is looking out of the window at the \nfading landscape outside. He is lost in thought.  \nThe song begins with a strong guitar riff. It gives a feeling of a strong \nsignificance that we are not aware of now, but will perhaps appreciate later. With the \nheavy riff mixes the Kashmiri cyclical pattern of song.  \nJordan, two years later, singing the song. He is recording the song in a studio.  \nA music CD on a retail rack. It is an album called \u00d4Sheher\u00d5. Songs are by Dilip \nMenon and Jordan. \nThe groove kicks in as Jordan performs the song at a small platform in a \nnightclub in Delhi. People dancing. We have seen a glimpse of this situation in the \ntitle sequence. This is a western rock song. It has a strong groove and some trance \nappeal.  \nAnother day, Jordan is sitting at the old ruins at sunset. This is where Heer and \nhe had country liquor. He is having an orange ice candy now, looking around.  \nJordan walks on a street divider during sun-set.  \nAfter sun set, he is looking at his Peetampura house from the shadows of the \nlane. \nLater, he is at the bar of a nightclub. He drains some alchohol from his glass \non to his hand, applies it to his neck and shirt, drains the rest into a large beaker.  \n! 76He gets up and walks to the dance area, beginning to move and dance and \npretending to be drunk. He enters the dance floor, dancing aggressively. He is dancing \nwith some new made friends.  \nAfter a while, we see that a girl on the dance floor is looking at him, trying to \nassess if it is him. She has been dancing with her friends, now she is moving to get a \nbetter look at Jordan\u00d5s face. He continues to dance in his manner.

Kya unki jaan bach \njayegi\u00c9?   \nJournalist 3 Prague mein Heer ke saath aapka chakkar chala \u00d0 kya usi ki vajah se \naap par criminal case thoka gaya tha? \nJordan keeps his head down and moves through the crowd. The first journalist \nis still persisting with him.  \nJournalist 1 Jordan, ek byte de deejiiye\u00c9 Jordan, sun rahe hain\u00c9? \n He holds Jordan\u00d5s arm. Jordan is walking up, without reacting.  \nJournalist 1 Kya Heer ab bhi Mr Jay Zutshi ki wife hai\u00c9? Kya vo India aapke liye \naayi? Jordan tumko Heer ke baare mein byte deni hogi\u00c9 Ek byte\u00c9 \nKuch to bolo\u00c9 Kya emotion hai tumhara? Kya tum Heer se pyaar \nkarte ho?  Haan\u00c9?

The film ramps to extreme high speed. The reporter falls, the camera smashes.  \nHeavy rock guitars begin to play in the soundtrack.  \nPeople try to stop Jordan, hold him. He hits them. \nHe screams.  \nHe is hit by some people, he hits back. \nCameras are flashing. \nHe falls.  \nRock guitars build up in the soundtrack.  \nPolice is seen pulling Jordan away.  \n! 265Jordan assaults a cop.  \nHe is getting smothered by the police, behind a police van.  \nThe music in the soundtrack builds up more.  \nThousands of people are waiting outside the court to catch a glimpse of his as \nJordan steps out. They go berserk on seeing him.  \nJordan shows them his middle finger, is taken towards the police van.  \nThe audience cheering him wildly.  \nSilence. \nThe waiting area of the hospital where Heer is admitted. Night. Jordan sitting \non a chair. Like he used to stand in front of his house.  \nJordan waiting.  \nRock music thickens in the soundtrack. \nBreaking all records, is a poster of Jordan\u00d5s latest album.  \nGlimpses of Jordan\u00d5s crazy life-style.  \nHe is puking at parties.  \nKhatana negotiating with some lawyers and corporates in a board room.  \nJordan is being clicked by a hundred cameras.  \nSilence. \nJordan sitting in the waiting area of Heer\u00d5s hospital at night.  \nUstad Jameel Khan, sitting in his room, looking to his right, tries to get up.  \nUstad\u00d5s nephews take him to the window, open it.  \n! 266There is a huge hoarding of Jordan endorsing a brand.  \nUstad looks at the hoarding with a bitter-sweet smile. \nMusic builds up. \nJordan\u00d5s new album on the stands of music shops.  \nMany pictures of Jordan in newspapers with various headings \u00d0 fights, legal \nbattles, great sales, nasty comments from him.  \nJordan\u00d5s niece looking.  \nJordan\u00d5s poster on his old room wall, in the middle of the old posters of Jim \nMorisson, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin etc. \nGirls screaming his name as Jordan\u00d5s car passes.  \nDhingra holds him happily and gets clicked. \nUnruly crowd at a publicity venue as Jordan walks out.  \nSilence. \nJordan sitting in the waiting area of Heer\u00d5s hospital at night.  \nLyrics of the song begin. \nJordan throws his cards down and picks up the money lying on the table. It is a \ngame of gambling at the pub in Verona. He gets up and kicks the table, the brass band \nmembers at the table are taken aback. One of them grabs him, he pushes him away, \nwalks out as the band members chase after him.  \nThe arena we saw at the beginning of the story.  \nThe gates open and crowd rushes in to be close to the stage.  \nJordan\u00d5s pictures on banners. Video screens and huge speakers.  \nNight. The music that is coming from the stage is setting the audience on fire.  \n! 267Jordan on stage, where we had seen him in the beginning.  \nThe song is a heart-rending cry of the soul \u00d0 in hard rock style. A hard, loud \nspectactle that breaks your heart.  \nI am trapped in a bad dream, the lyrics are saying. I want to wake up. Because \nwhen I wake up, I know I will be with you.  \nRiots and stampedes and faintings as he sings his heart out to the bright \nscanner lights.  \nThis is Jordan, the icon of modern music, performing live. \n Midways in the performance, in the middle of a line, Jordan stops singing. He \nfalls silent, stares in front.  \nThe music plays for some time, then comes to a stop.  \nJordan is staring into space, lost to the world, in a trance.  \nThe bright lights wash him.  \nJordan is looking at Heer.  \nHeer is stepping up from the middle of stage. She looks at him. She is looking \nbright, untouched by any illness.  \nHeer smiles at Jordan, begins to walk to him.  \nJordan is looking at her. The audience begins to cheer aloud. Jordan, Jordan, \nJordan \u00d0 the stadium is heard bellowing.  \nHeer reaches him, smiling. She has come to him. She becomes translucent for \na moment, then opaque again.  \nJordan stands there, staring into space. Jordan, Jordan, Jordan, the stadium \nechoes. But all the sound fades out. He is looking at Heer.  \nIt is only her and him. She is smiling at him.  \nHe is seeing her.  \nHeer\u00d5s Voice-over is heard \u00d0 \u00d2Shh\u00c9\u00d3  \n! 268Black.  \nHeer\u00d5s voice resounds \u00d0 \u00d2Shh\u00c9\u00d3 \n{5 \" mins} \n/74 mins/ \nSc # 130 (Part Two)     Day, Interiors \n       Mcleodgunj Hotel Room \nFlashback.

They are \nfrolicking. Heer is pretending to fly with her arms.  \n The song begins in the background.  \nThis is the song that Jordan had sung to Heer. A light, happy, personal song. \nThe only song he had sung for her. And only for her.  \nWe see him singing this for her at different times. In Prague, and Delhi \u00d0 \nduring their times together.  \nThis is interspersed with visuals of Heer and Jordan at the happiest times in \ntheir lives. In their journey together.  \n  Now you never have to leave, the song says. I do not have to look for you \nanymore. We are together now. We are together forever. \n{4 mins} \n/79 mins/ \n< End > \n********* 1 hr 14 mins \n1 hr 19 mins \n<2 hr 33 mins> \nImtiaz Ali \n29th Jan \u00d411 \n! 271"
